# Contribution and customization

In case you haven't noticed yet, I'm a pretty big fan of the [Elm programming language](http://elm-lang.org/). It provides a strong safety thanks to its type system, by forcing you to consider all cases that could happen. As a consequence, a program that compiles will **most likely never produce a runtime error**. The only bugs that can happen, are those related to the app behavior, or browser compatibility. Thus, contrary to [most alternatives](https://reva-n7.gitbook.io/annotation-app/alternatives), this application should **perform extremely reliably**. If you find any bug, please report it by creating an issue in the [github project page](https://github.com/mpizenberg/annotation-app/issues).
